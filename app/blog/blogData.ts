      <p>High-functioning anxiety is not a clinical diagnosis, but it is a reality for many of the high-achievers I work with. It is the feeling of walking a tightrope—maintaining a perfect exterior while internally managing a constant stream of worry, self-doubt, and physical tension.</p>
      <h3>The Mask of Perfection</h3>
      <p>Often, this anxiety fuels success. It pushes you to prepare more, work harder, and anticipate every possible outcome. But the cost is exhaustion. The adrenaline that drives you eventually depletes you.</p>
      <h3>Breaking the Cycle</h3>
      <p>Healing doesn't mean lowering your standards. It means learning to separate your worth from your output. It involves recognizing the physical signals of safety in your body and learning to trust them, rather than relying on the adrenaline of 'fight or flight' to get through your workday.</p>

    excerpt:
      "For trauma survivors and high-achievers, slowing down can often feel more terrifying than speeding up.",
    content: `
      <p>We are often told to 'just relax,' as if it were a switch we could flip. But for many, stillness is not peaceful—it is threatening.</p>
      <h3>The Nervous System on Overdrive</h3>
      <p>When you have spent years in survival mode, your nervous system interprets 'calm' as 'vulnerable.' If you are not busy, you are not safe. This is why you might feel an itch of agitation the moment you try to meditate or take a nap.</p>
      <h3>Safe Stillness</h3>
      <p>We start small. We don't aim for an hour of meditation. We aim for three breaths where we actually feel the chair underneath us. We build safety in the stillness, one moment at a time.</p>

      "Boundaries are not walls; they are the guidelines that allow us to stay connected safely.",
    content: `
      <p>Many of us were raised to believe that saying 'no' is selfish. We overextend ourselves to keep the peace, only to find ourselves resentful and burnt out later.</p>
      <p>A boundary is simply a statement of what is okay and what is not okay. It is an act of self-respect that actually improves relationships. When you are clear about your limits, you can show up more fully when you say 'yes'.</p>

      "Balance isn't a static state we achieve; it's a constant shifting of weight.",
    content: `
      <p>We tend to think of balance as a destination—a place where everything is perfectly equal and stable. But life is dynamic. True balance is the ability to sway without falling.</p>
      <p>Sometimes work requires more. Sometimes family does. The goal isn't equal time, but presence. Are you fully where you are?</p>
