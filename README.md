## 📌 Project Overview

This project addresses two core challenges:

### UI Cloning
Recreating the layout, spacing, and responsive structure of the **“Lilac” Squarespace template**, including complex grid systems and section rhythms.

### Creative Redesign
Reimagining the brand identity for **Dr. Maya Reynolds** using a new visual language—color palette, typography, and copy—while preserving the original architectural layout.

**Live Demo:** _Add Vercel / Netlify link_

## 🎨 Design Rationale — *The Sanctuary Theme*

The original “Lilac” aesthetic was replaced with a grounded, earth-tone system to align with Dr. Maya’s clinical focus on burnout recovery and grounding techniques.

### Color Palette

- **Primary — `#2C332A` (Deep Forest)**  
  Used for headings, body text, and primary actions to convey stability and professionalism.

- **Background — `#F9F7F2` (Warm Sand)**  
  A soft off-white base that reduces eye strain and creates a calm, “safe space” feel.

- **Secondary Accents — `#8A9A5B` (Moss), `#E8E6E1` (Greige)**  
  Used for section separation (CTAs, newsletter, content blocks) without disrupting the overall calm aesthetic.

### Typography

- **Headings:** Playfair Display (Serif)  
  Adds editorial elegance and clinical authority.

- **Body:** Inter (Sans-serif)  
  Ensures high readability for long-form content.
